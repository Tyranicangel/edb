						“We, the Andhras, are fortunately situated in some respects. I firmly believe that if any part of India is capable of developing an effective sense of unity it is in Andhra. The hold of conservatism is not strong. Our generosity of spirit and openness of mind are well -known. Our social instinct and suggestibility are still active. Our moral sense and sympathetic imagination are not much warped by dogma. Our women are relatively more free. Love of the mother-tongue binds us all.”
						<br /><br />

						<b>Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan</b><br />

									    	<b>Religion, Feasts and Festival</b>
											<br /><br />
											The Dwaita, the Visishtadwaita, the Advaita, and Saivite faiths coexist in Andhra Pradesh among Hindus, while Muslims and Christians also live side by side with tolerance. The Sakti, in her finer and cruder manifestations is also worshipped. In the better and richer type of villages, the temples of Vishnu, Siva and Sakti prevail. Vighneswara, Srirama and Hanuman are also provided in these shrines. Religious or sectarian fanaticism in general does not exist in the State of Andhra Pradesh.
											<br /><br />

											Some of the famous temples in Andhra Pradesh are at Simahachalam, Sun temple in Arasavalli in Srikakulam District), Draksharama, Bhadrachalam in Khammam District, Annavaram and Antarvedi in the East Godavari District, Mangalagiri in Guntur District, Achanta, Palakol, Dwaraka Tirumala in West Godavari, Tirupati and Kalahasti in Chittoor, Kanaka Durga at Vijayawada in Krishna and Ahobilam in Kurnool District. The other famous temples are in Srikakulam, Mukhalingam. Kotappakonda, Srisailam and Mahanandi. All of them are structures of great antiquity and possess rare architectural values. Christian churches in places like Medak and mosques in Hyderabad are noteworthy. In addition to these, local deities called Gramadevatas are held in reverence. Jataras are celebrated. They do not belong to any particular denomination. The Hindu priest would officiate at their ceremonies; nevertheless the villager regards them with awe and never fails to do obeisance before them. These are located generally on the village outskirts, the idol consisting of a stone smeared liberally with oil, saffron, kumkum and turmeric. The Gramadevatas, one comes across in rural Andhra are innumerable and are given local names such as Gangamma, Gogulamma, Nukalamma, Vellamma, Chinnamma, Muthyalammma, Bangaramma, Ankalamma, Pyditalli, Perantalamma and Poturaju. If disregarded for too long, people believe they cause diseases and disasters in the village. Animal or fowl sacrifice is practiced to appease them. The religion of the hill tribes is based largely on superstition and animism. Witchcraft and animal sacrifice are also widely believed, though they are becoming things of the past by the spread of modern education. The most terrible visitation in the eyes of the Koya tribe in Godavari Valley are eclipses of the sun and the moon for they believe that the devil in the shape of a serpent or a tiger is thereby trying to swallow the earth. They ward it off by beating drums all the time the eclipse lasts.

											<b>Feasts and Festivals</b>
											<br /><br />
											Andhras observe many feasts and festivals. Most of them have some religious significance; but they are notable mainly for the occasion for gaiety and merry making they provide. On such days every household is decorated with floral and green leaf torana hung across the windows and doors. The courtyard is decorated tastefully with designs of muggu powder (rangoli) and the doorsteps are painted with daubs of turmeric and kumkum pastes. Dhoop sticks and dhup, sambrani are burnt in all the homes and the air is filled with aromatic smell. People wear new clothes; the lady of the house cooks special dishes and generally some community function is held near the village temple or at a common place. There are nine major festivals observed by Andhras; seven of them religious and two agricultural.
